1. NODE JS BASICS
    - Node JS is a JavaScript Framework
    - Node JS is based on the V8 engine by Chrome
    - Installing Node JS: https://nodejs.org/en/
    - Checking Node version: node -v
    - Starting the Node REPL: node
    - Executing a Node JS file in the Node REPL: .load [FILENAME].js
    - Purposes of Node JS:
        - Input validation
        - User authentication and authorization
        - Database access
    - REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
    
2. FILE SYSTEM
    - Requiring the file system: const fs = require("fs")
    - Creating a file: fs.writeFileSync([FILE NAME], [FILE-CONTENT])
    - Deleting a file: fs.unlinkSync([FILE NAME])

3. JAVASCRIPT BASICS
    - Creating an array with the invidual items of another array: const NewArray = [...originalArray]
    - Creating an array from individual items: function f(...arrayName)
    - Destructuring objects: const { property1, property2 } = objects
    . Destructuirng arrays: const [ item1, item2 ] = array

4. NODE JS SERVERS
    - Core modules: http, https, fs, path, os
    - HTTP requests and responses always include headers that pass metadata (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)
    - res.end() must always be the last call on res
    - Buffers are responsible for putting data streams to a halt when necessary
